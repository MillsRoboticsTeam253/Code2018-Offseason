# Code 2018 Offseason
This functions as a test and development repo for team 253's 2018 offseason code. 

## Changes from Code2018
In preparation for the new 2019 WPILib control system, we have moved to using Intellij as an IDE and Gradle for robot code deployment. To get the most out of this code, install IntelliJ on your machine and open `Code2018.ipr`. It should take a moment to import the Gradle project. After it loads, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Alt+1` to get to the project manager.

## Getting Started

### Installing and Using Git
To get started, you'll first have to install Git on your machine. Open [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), navigate to the instruction section for your machine's OS, and follow the instructions there. Restart your machine if you want to be safe.

Then, create a folder for this project. I personally use the one IntelliJ generates, located at `user/IdeaProjects`, (where `user` is your user directory) and create a folder inside named `Code2018`.

Finally, open your native command line processor. On MacOS this will be Terminal; and on Windows, cmd (I prefer Powershell but you can use either). 

Here is where things will get difficult. Due to the various places your project folder could be, I cannot give instructions that will work for everyone. I also do not have a Mac and cannot attest to the functionality of this next step. However, for the sake of consistency, I will assume you have your project folder in `user/IdeaProjects/Code2018` Run the command `cd /IdeaProjects/Code2018` on Mac, and `cd C:\Users\user\IdeaProjects\Code2018` on Windows.

Finally, run `git clone https://github.com/MillsRoboticsTeam253/Code2018-Offseason.git`. This should fetch the code from this repo and download it to the folder you navigated to in the previous step.

You should now have a (hopefully) functioning version of this year's code. Get coding!
